|------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Depression** | 2.201 | Overwhelming strongest predictor |
| 2 | **LGBT Identity** | 0.967 | Strong association with risk |
| 3 | **Bullying Experience** | 0.378 | Significant victimization effect |
| 4 | **Transgender Identity** | 0.228 | Additional minority stress |
| 5 | **Female Gender** | 0.138 | Gender-specific risk pattern |

### Clinical Insights
- **Mental Health**: Depression dominates all other factors
- **Identity Stress**: LGBT and transgender identity show substantial risk
- **Social Environment**: Bullying creates significant vulnerability

## Slide 7: Protective Factors & Substance Use

### Protective Factors (Negative Associations)
| Factor | Coefficient | Protective Effect |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Regular Breakfast** | -0.185 | Strong protective factor |
| **Academic Performance** | -0.041 | Modest protective effect |

### Substance Use Risk Factors
| Substance | Coefficient | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Vaping** | 0.129 | Moderate risk |
| **Alcohol** | 0.062 | Low-moderate risk |
| **Drug Use Composite** | 0.040 | Low risk |
| **Cigarettes** | 0.021 | Minimal risk |
| **Cannabis** | 0.006 | Minimal risk |

### Key Finding
**Regular breakfast consumption emerges as the strongest protective factor** - possibly indicating family stability and routine.

## Slide 8: Environmental & Social Factors

### Drug Environment
- **Drug Access**: 0.125 coefficient
- **Drug Education**: 0.040 coefficient
- **Interpretation**: Perceived access to drugs increases risk more than lack of education

### Family & Academic Factors
- **Parental Education**: 0.100 coefficient (positive - higher education = slight risk increase)
- **Academic Performance**: -0.041 coefficient (protective)
- **Unexpected Finding**: Higher parental education shows slight risk increase

### Social Dynamics
- **Bullying**: 0.378 coefficient - third strongest risk factor
- **Gender Effects**: Female gender shows increased risk (0.138)

## Slide 9: Prediction Distribution Analysis

### Risk Stratification
- **Minimum Predicted Risk**: 1.25%
- **Median Risk**: 5.31%
- **75th Percentile**: 26.67%
