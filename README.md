## Overview

The Indigenous Wholistic Factors Project (IWFP) is a community-centered, data-driven initiative aimed at advancing culturally grounded understandings of suicide risk and protective factors among Native American youth in California. This repository supports the manuscript:

**"Predicting Suicidal Ideation Among Native American High Schoolers in California"**  

This study uses data from the 2019â€“2020 California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) and is guided by Indigenous Wholistic Theory and the Indigenous Computational Approach. A LASSO logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of past-year suicidal ideation among Native American high school students.

## Project Goals

- Advance culturally grounded knowledge of risk and protective factors to support suicide prevention among Native American youth in California
- Apply community-centered machine learning methods through the Indigenous Computational Approach to support ethical, culturally grounded public health research
- Promote open science practices that align with Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles

## Software Requirements

### Stata Version
Analyses require **Stata/SE 17.0 or higher** and the following user-written packages:

- `lasso2` â€“ Penalized regression
- `cvauroc` â€“ AUC estimation
- `calibrationbelt` â€“ Model calibration assessment
- `moremata` â€“ Matrix and math utilities

Install them in Stata using:

```stata
ssc install lasso2
ssc install cvauroc
ssc install calibrationbelt
ssc install moremata
```

### Python Version
Alternatively, you can run the analyses using **Python 3.7+** with the following packages:

- `pandas` â€“ Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` â€“ Numerical computing
- `scikit-learn` â€“ Machine learning (includes LASSO regression)
- `matplotlib` â€“ Plotting and visualization
- `seaborn` â€“ Statistical data visualization
- `scipy` â€“ Statistical functions

Install Python dependencies using:

```bash
cd scripts/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Quick start with Python:

```bash
# Test data loading first
python test_data_loading.py

# Run primary analysis
python primary_analysis.py
```

For detailed Python usage instructions, see `scripts/README_python.md`.
